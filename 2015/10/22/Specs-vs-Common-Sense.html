<p>So I was reading through <a href="http://reddit.com">reddit</a> during my lunch break at work and I came
across this picture:</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Apparently the kid did not follow the specific method the teacher has taught the class during
the past weeks, presumably he wants the students to have a huge loathing against commutative
addition or to common sense, or even worse: <strong>creative and different thinking</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;m not writing a post against any educational system, I mean the kid got a D with no wrong answers,
that&#8217;s pretty unfair. But I&#8217;m not an expert in that field, or actually any field to begin with. What
really got my attention were the comments that followed this post in reddit:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I actually just recently ran into an issue with my programming course where they knocked off 10
points because my output was 1 cent off what their "desired" output was, regardless of the fact
that my program was actually rounding properly instead of truncating, making it more accurate
than it actually was. I never hated a teacher so much in my life.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve got bad, bad news for you if you want to be a software engineer that works for money.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>He can&#8217;t be more right! I&#8217;ve gone through similar situations during my career, in many projects
and in very different scales. What I&#8217;ve really learned is that you have to choose your battles,
you&#8217;re paid for your expertise and for your skills, my problem is that I have amazing skills
to detect this kind of problems (The client wants something that will eventually lead you and
him to hours of frustration and bug hunting due to bad approaches and rules that don&#8217;t follow
common sense), my advantage is that I have good ways to work this through by communication and
negotiation (Sometimes the client really wants that feature that will shut his business down
and it will be extremely hard to convince him otherwise).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So what do I recommend: don&#8217;t be an asshole. When some points in the specs doesn&#8217;t follow common
sense or has some technical underlying issue &#8594; Go and talk about it with your client/boss since
it will free you from the suffering caused by taking one of the 2 potentially wrong decisions:
1. You fix it and keep your mouth shut, then it will explode in your face when he tells you that
it was primordial for the product. You fix it back, it explodes on his face and then you find a 3rd
solution that was the ideal one to begin with.
2. You do it just as it&#8217;s detailed in the specifications and then it explodes in your client&#8217;s face,
the client loses money/time/users and you simply say 'it was written here' and I said nothing about
it because I didn&#8217;t have to.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Anyways, you can also have the case of having specs that do not make sense (or common sense) in
many areas (disorganized, contradictions, etc). In such cases it&#8217;s always good, in my opinion, to
start your own documentation stack, or your own specification in a better format and language. For
these cases I&#8217;ve recently found that my colleague&#8217;s
<a href="https://twitter.com/<em>jameswatts</em>">@<em>jameswatts</em></a>
specification for <strong>XHTTP</strong> is really well outlined and it&#8217;s a nice starting point:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="http://www.xhttp.org/specification">XHTTP Specification</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What was the nicest decision the kid should&#8217;ve made that day during that exam? Probably the one he
took, he went ahead and found a solution for a problem that was given to him. Probably his parents
will pay a visit to the school and hopefully this teacher stops killing kid&#8217;s motivation to learn
and specially learn math.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For a final statement I will leave here another comment from the thread that really rounds things up
with this topic by explaining a real life example of how common sense might not make your life easier
all the time:</p>

<p>Hey, former dev at a bank here.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Being "better" isn&#8217;t strictly right. This isn&#8217;t just your professor being an asshole, I was on an actual
project that had pretty much this exact same problem.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Project involved effectively automating some collateral value calculations. We were given a spreadsheet
with some sample values and were given the maths and were told to match output. We didn&#8217;t bother to check
that the formatting rules truncated at certain point (at the millions). We get into UAT and the business
test team throws a fit because their numbers aren&#8217;t matching up. 6 hours of stepping through the math process
starting at 3 am before we figured out that having "wrong" (truncated) numbers was an important aspect of
something negotiated in the contract underlying this particular calculation. In other words, even though it
represented (across the full range of clients for this tool) a multi-million dollar disadvantage, we were
still supposed to directly do it wrong.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>TL:DR it&#8217;s not just your professor, sometimes it&#8217;s your job to do it specifically wrong</p>
