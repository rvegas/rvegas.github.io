# Specs vs Common Sense

So I was reading through http://reddit.com[reddit] during my lunch break at work and I came 
accross this picture:

Apparently the kid did not follow the specific method the teacher has taught the class during 
the past weeks, presumably he wants the students to have a huge loathing against commutative 
addition or to common sense, or even worse: *creative and different thinking*.

I'm not writing a post against any educational system, I mean the kid got a D with no wrong answers, 
that's pretty unfair. But I'm not an expert in that field, or actually any field to begin with. What 
really got my attention were the comments that followed this post in reddit:

I actually just recently ran into an issue with my programming course where they knocked off 10 
points because my output was 1 cent off what their "desired" output was, regardless of the fact 
that my program was actually rounding properly instead of truncating, making it more accurate 
than it actually was. I never hated a teacher so much in my life.

I've got bad, bad news for you if you want to be a software engineer that works for money.

He can't be more right! I've gone through similar situations during my career, in many projects 
and in very different scales. What I've really learned is that you have to choose your battles, 
you're paid for your expertise and for your skills, my problem is that I have amazing skills 
to detect this kind of problems (The client wants something that will eventually lead you and 
him to hours of frustration and bug hunting due to bad approaches and rules that don't follow 
common sense), my advantage is that I have good ways to work this through by communication and 
negotiation (Sometimes the client really wants that feature that will shut his business down 
and it will be extremely hard to convince him otherwise). 

So what do I recommend: don't be an asshole. When some points in the specs doesn't follow common 
sense or has some technical underlying issue -> Go and talk about it with your client/boss since 
it will free you from the suffering caused by taking one of the 2 potentially wrong decisions: 
1. You fix it and keep your mouth shut, then it will explode in your face when he tells you that 
it was primordial for the product. You fix it back, it explodes on his face and then you find a 3rd 
solution that was the ideal one to begin with.
2. You do it just as it's detailed in the specifications and then it explodes in your client's face, 
the client loses money/time/users and you simply say 'it was written here' and I said nothing about 
it because I didn't have to.

Anyways, you can also have the case of having specs that do not make sense (or common sense) in 
many areas (disorganized, contradictions, etc). In such cases it's always good, in my opinion, to 
start your own documentation stack, or your own specification in a better format and language. For 
these cases I've recently found that my colleague's link:https://twitter.com/_jameswatts_[@_jameswatts_]
