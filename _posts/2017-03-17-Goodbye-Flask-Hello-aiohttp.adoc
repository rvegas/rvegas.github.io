# Goodbye Flask, Hello aiohttp

:hp-tags: api, flask, python, python3

For the past years, I've been working mostly on Microservices, Architecture and API development. I've been through many tools and frameworks under PHP, Python and Scala. I cannot state which is the best way to go, but so far my default configuration is *Python 3.5* with *virtualenv*.

## Why Python?

I'm not one to defend *Python*(3.5+) over other languages, each project has its own problems that can be solved in many ways. But one of the main obstacles that I tend to find is the development setup and its differences with the production setup.

Regarding provisioning and project environments there are many solutions out there (link:docker.com[Docker], link:vagrang.com[Vagrant], link:http://mesos.apache.org/[Apache Mesos], etc) but I've found that Python's link:http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/[Virtualenv] is one of the most versatiles tools for this particular problem.



## Let's Begin

So the first question I always ask myself when making this kind of experiments is : *_What do I start with?_*. Well my answer to that question is normally *_with whatever I find myself having more fun!_*. If I remember correctly, after checking out all of these available tools, the one that excited me the most was obviously *Kibana*, I mean, have you seen those graphs? Isn't it awesome how many different ways are there to organize and display metrics and data? So yeah, let's begin by setting up Kibana.

### Setting up kibana

You might think I'm an asshole for this, but seriously, just go to https://www.elastic.co/downloads/kibana and follow the instructions :)

After this, just go to http://localhost:5601/

WARNING: If you do not have elastic search running Kibana will fail to load of course, if you want a cool way to set it up I recommend you to link:http://ricardo.vegas/2015/05/23/Setup-and-host-an-elasticsearch-server-on-Amazon-EC2-using-Vagrant.html[check this out].

TIP: I had some problems with the elasticsearch version (Kibana needs 1.4.4) but this helped me out link:https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/1.3/setup-upgrade.html[Rolling Upgrade for elasticsearch]

After you're through this you will get to the kibana dashboard, which looks like this:

There is little to be done here, so let's mov
