# Livestreaming twitter updates into Kibana using Firehose and RabbitMQ

:hp-tags: twitter, kibana, elasticsearch, php

Last time I wrote a small guide or actually a log of what it took me to build a elasticsearch cluster using vagrant and puphet. Since then I've been working some more with elasticsearch and discovered link:https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana[Kibana] and wow isn't that something cool!?

I decided then to put up a small experiment by reading *Twitter* status updates and dumping them into a elastic search collection so I could later build some graphs based on the characteristics of the tweets (language, sentiment, place, brand, user, whatever I could get).

## Kibana, RabbitMQ, Firehose???

Ok I think it's a good idea to explain the tools and technologies I used during the experiment. They're pretty well known and quite easy to setup and understand.


*Kibana* is a visualization tool that is architected to work with *elasticsearch*, it can also load data from many other sources and it has many features, tweaks, tricks and usages just like elasticsearch does.

link:https://rabbitmq.com[*RabbitMQ*] is a messaging queue system, built around Erlang and widely used for big scale projects (big data) and I would recommend to at least give it some consderation when you're developing something that needs communication between services or heavy asynchronous operations.

*Firehose*
